# ECE309
 All homework programs and my Streetmap Project created during my time in ECE 309 at North Carolina State University during the Spring 2023 semester.

 Streetmap Project:
  The streetmap project was a courselong project that takes a map files that includes node and way data, and finds the shortest path between two user-specified nodes. Various data structures, such as hash tables, linked
  lists, and trees were used to sort and manage data. Time complexities were considered in choosing what data was stored in what type of data structure. Various classes were defined and implemented with appropriate member
  variables and functions. I used Djikstra's algorithm to find the shortest path and BFS and DFS to find certain nodes based on what critera the search required. CMake build software was used to run, debug, and test (Google
  Test) my program.
